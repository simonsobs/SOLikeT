# Parameters to build a top-hat band:
# - nsteps sets the number of frequencies used in the band integration
# - bandwidth sets the relative width of the band wrt the central frequency
#   the central frequency of each band is set from the bands stored in the sacc file
#     - with nstep: 1, bandwidth must be 0
#     Dirac delta bandpass, no band integration
#     useful if you don't want to do band integration
#     when the bandpasses in the sacc file are multifrequency
#     the freq used is the effective frequency from the bandpass
#     - if nstep > 1,  bandwidth must be > 1
#     bandwidth can be a list if you want a different width for each band
#     e.g. bandwidth: [0.3,0.2,0.3] for 3 bands
# when top_hat_band is a null dict: no top-hat band is built and
# bandpasses read from sacc file. Band integration is performed accordingly
# (if bandpass in sacc is a single freq, no band integration)
# the default is to read bandpasses from file, to build top-hat uncomment the
# parameters of the block!
# Bandpass has to be in RJ units
top_hat_band:
#  nsteps: 1
#  bandwidth: 0


# If passband read from an external file, provide the field
# "filepath" with the correct path 
external_bandpass:
  #filepath: path
